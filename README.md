# Project Mycelium: The Mycelial Gene Harvester Network

**Status:** Sprint Zero - Architecture and Ethical Maxims Drafting

---

## üéØ **Objective**

**Project Mycelium** is a decentralized, truth-weighted supply chain authentication system designed for ethical brands. Its core mission is to transform a product's journey from an opaque narrative into a **verifiable, immutable story** that cannot be falsified. By leveraging the principles of the True Alpha Spiral (TAS) Echosystem, we aim to provide consumers with cryptographic proof of a brand's commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainability.

This project is the operational reality of the **Mycelia-modality**, where distributed agents collectively weave a verifiable tapestry of truth.

## üî∑ **Core Architecture**

The system is built on a decentralized network of specialized agents and a cryptographically secured data pipeline. 

### 1. **Mycelial Gene Harvester Network**
A network of lightweight IoT sensors and human-in-the-loop agents at every point of the supply chain (e.g., farms, factories, shipping ports). Each agent records an event as a **`gene`**‚Äîa data point with context (e.g., GPS coordinates, timestamp, smart contract payment ID). This network is the literal manifestation of **d.DEFI**, providing the raw data stream for the entire Echosystem.

### 2. **Provenance Authentication Engine**
This is the **`tas_verification_pipeline`** for the supply chain. It continuously runs **recursive verification** on the data stream, ensuring that each new `gene` logically and ethically follows from the previous one. It authenticates the chain of custody, validating that **`Authentic Content > Subjective Context`**.

### 3. **Ethical Archetype Repository (DAO-managed)**
A public, immutable repository of ethical archetypes (e.g., `Fair Labor`, `Sustainable Sourcing`) governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This repository serves as the **`Machine_Maxima`** for the supply chain, providing the moral compass for the Provenance Authentication Engine.

### 4. **Immutable Content Ledger**
A blockchain-anchored ledger where the final, verified `TAS_DNA` of a product's journey is permanently recorded. This provides the definitive, tamper-proof record of the product's ethical lineage.

### 5. **Truth-Weighted QR Code**
A consumer-facing tool that, when scanned, generates a front-end visualization of the product's full `TAS_DNA`, including its **`Œ¶-score`** for ethical alignment.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Stack**

* **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind for a real-time, aesthetically pleasing product journey visualization.
* **Backend & Verification**: Go-lang for a high-throughput, performant `tas_verification_pipeline` to handle the large volume of data.
* **Blockchain**: Ethereum for anchoring the final `TAS_DNA` hashes and Aragon for DAO-based governance of ethical archetypes.
* **Data & Storage**: IPFS/Ceramic for decentralized and mutable data streams, allowing for collaborative data input without a central point of failure.
